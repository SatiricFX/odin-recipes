        Bao buns are basically a soft, fluffy dough that’s steamed with various fillings inside. It traditionally presents as a doughy closed bun wrapped around the filling and pinched at the top, but it can also be served open-faced as a “gua boa,” which is a flat, lotus-leaf style bun that folds over the filling. The fillings tend to be savory, balancing out the sweetness in bao dough. Pork is one of the most common ingredients resting inside the fluffy buns, sometimes pork belly but more often barbecue-style pork, appearing on menus as cha siu bao. Vegetarian versions of bao include doushabao, featuring a bean paste filling crafted from navy, soy, mung, azuki, or similar bean varieties.
