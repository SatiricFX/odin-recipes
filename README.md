The Odin Project is a free open-source curriculum that teaches web development. The curriculum is divided into two parts: the **Foundations** course and the **Full Stack** course. The Foundations course covers the basics of web development such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby. The Full Stack course covers more advanced topics such as databases, Ruby on Rails, and React. The Odin Project is designed to be self-paced and includes a community of learners who can help you along the way.
